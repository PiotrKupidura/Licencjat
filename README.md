# Conditional Variational Autoencoder for Protein Sturcture Generation

## Description
This repository contains a deep-learing model for generating short fragents of three-dimensional protein structues, which was developed as a part of my bachelors thesis. In order to achieve roto-translational invariance the model operates on internal coordinates of the protein - it generates torsion angles which are then used to reconstruct the Cartesian coordinates. The loss function is then computed over those coordinates so that it is possible to condition the model on the desired fragment orientation (to make the generated fragment fit tightly into the existing structure). The model may also be conditioned on the desired amino acid sequence and secondary structure (helix, sheet or coil). Proposed approach allows to generate fragments with realistic conformations (as demonstrated by the example structures and Ramachandran plots) with the quality of the structures decreasing as their length increases. <img width="772" height="660" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33e39174-9b15-4ebe-b483-b85fc106f880" />

## Basic usage

Pretrained models are available at https://huggingface.co/PiotrKupidura/Licencjat

### Config file

The config.json file should contain following entries
- "dir_read" - directory containing the .npy files created by the create_dataset script, only required for training
- "n" - length of the fragments generated by the model
- "train_batch_size" and "val_batch_size"
- "epochs" - maximal number of training epochs
- "beta_min" and "beta_max" - minimal and maximal value of the loss coefficient corresponding to the KL divergence term, the value for each epochs is determined by cyclic annealing
- "learning_rate"
### Scripts
#### Insert fragments
```
python3 insert_fragments.py -aa -ss -f -s -e -m -r
```
Generates a fragment with the desired amino acid sequence, secondary structure and orientation and inserts it into a PDB file
.
##### Parameters:
- aa - amino acid sequence of the generated fragment (optional, defaults to the sequence from PDB file)
- ss - secondary structure in HEC format (optional, defaults to the secondary structure from PDB file)
- f - path to the PDB file into which the fragment will be inserted
- s - number of the first residue in the fragment
- e - number of the last residue in the fragment
- m - path to the .pt file with the pretrained model
- r - number of fragments to be generated

##### Example usage
```
python3 insert_fragments.py -aa -ss  -f 2VZ5.pdb -s -e -m model.pt -r 50
```
#### Train
```
python3 train.py
```

Trains the model.
#### Create dataset from PDB
```
python3 create_dataset_from_pdb.py -dir_read -dir_write -list_path -len_fragment
```

Extracts the backbone coordinates, amino acid sequence and secondary structure from PDB files and saves them in .npy format.

##### Parameters:
- dir_read - directory containing the PDB files to be parsed
- dir_write - directory into which the .npy files should be saved
- list_path - path to a .txt file containing chain names and their corresponding weights
- len_fragment - length of the created fragments (should be 1 more than the desired fragment length (n in config) as the first 3 atoms are not included in the reconstruction
#### Extract secondary structures
```
python3 extract_structures.py -dir_read -dir_write
```
Extracts all fragments containing only one secondary structures to be used for validation.
##### Parameters
- dir_read - directory containing PDB files to be processed
- dir_write - directory where the resulting .npy files should be saved
#### Validation query
```
python3 validation_query.py -model -n -dir_read
```
Generates a given number of fragments and for each of them computes the distance (RMSD after superposition) to its closer neighbour from PDB.
##### Parameters:
- model - path to the .pt file with the pretrained model
- dir_read - directory containing the .npy files created by extract_structures.py
- n - number of fragments to be generated
#### Bounding ball
```
python3 bounding_ball.py -model -n
```
Comptues the radii of the bounding balls of atoms of a given index across multiple fragments as a measure of their diversity.
##### Parameters:
- model - path to the .pt file with the pretrained model
- n - number of fragments to be generated
